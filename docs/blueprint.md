## Core Features:

- Shipment Creation: Allow admin and employee users to manually create shipment requests with sender, receiver, and shipment details.
- Customer Management: Manage permanent and temporary customer data. Temporary customers don't require an account; employees will enter customer information during shipment creation, but returning temporary customers' info shall be retained. Temporary customers can track shipments using a tracking code.
- Shipment Tracking: Enable shipment tracking via manually updated status changes (e.g., received, in transit, delivered, returned, rejected). Status updates are entered by reps and employees, not via GPS.
- Delivery Staff Interface: Enable delivery staff to view assigned orders, accept tasks (if within a group assignment), update order status, upload proof of delivery (signature or photo), and add shipment notes.
- Admin Dashboard: Admin panel for creating shipments, assigning to individual staff or groups, dividing orders across multiple staff, monitoring shipment progress, editing/rescheduling/canceling orders, and managing staff performance.
- Invoicing and Payments: Generate automatic invoices for each order, support cash, bank transfer, and electronic payments, and export invoices as PDF or send via email.
- User Roles and Permissions: Implement role-based access control: admin (full control), staff (order entry, status updates), delivery staff (task execution, status updates), permanent client (tracking, orders, payments), and temporary client (tracking via code).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #29ABE2 (RGB), a vibrant blue, evokes reliability, trust, and efficiency which aligns with the prompt. This will also contrast well with a light or dark background scheme.
- Background color: #F0F8FF (RGB), a very light blue that maintains a professional aesthetic, complements the primary blue without causing distractions.
- Accent color: #FF69B4 (RGB), a bright pink, chosen as an analogous color to the blue. This offers a modern and eye-catching interface while making CTAs stand out.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif for a precise, contemporary feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to create a more friendly and warmer look. This font works best for a more extensive text.
- Simple, clear icons for shipment status and navigation. Consider a consistent line weight and style for all icons.
- Clean, intuitive layout with clear hierarchy. Prioritize essential information (tracking status, order details) for easy access.
